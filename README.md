# multilingualFlask
Multilingual Flask Boilerplate with smart routing optimised for search engines and including separate URLâ€™s for each language.
I created this application as example code for a Medium article which is linked below.

### Build

```
docker build -t flask-gunicorn-app .
docker run -p 80:80 --name multilangapp flask-gunicorn-app
```
Results in:
```
